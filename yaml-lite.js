// A hand-rolled parser for exactly the YAML subset GitHub Actions workflow
// files use — block mappings, block and flow sequences, plain/quoted
// scalars, and literal/folded block scalars. Nothing else: no anchors,
// aliases, tags, multi-document streams, or complex (multi-line) flow
// mappings. Encountering one of those is a bug in this parser's scope, not
// a thing to guess at, so it throws rather than silently returning
// something wrong.
//
// Exists so npm-update-workflow.test.js can assert real structure instead
// of regex/string-matching over serialized YAML text — a class of fragility
// this file hit directly: a "no expression is spliced into any run: block"
// sweep written as a block-boundary regex couldn't reliably tell a run:
// script line from an env: declaration or a with: input, and needed several
// rounds of exclusion patches to stop false-positiving on its own fixes.
// Ported verbatim from mikelward/ci-commit-artifact, which hit the same
// problem first and built this to fix it — see that repository's AGENTS.md
// for the fuller argument. Kept in-process and dependency-free on purpose,
// matching this repository's own "no dependencies, no package.json, no
// lockfile" rule: shelling out to python3 for a real YAML parser (PyYAML,
// as mikelward/codex-review's check_consumer.py does) would be a second
// runtime taken on for test-time convenience, not a structural need the way
// it is there.
//
// Deliberately does NOT implement YAML 1.1's `on`/`off`/`yes`/`no`-as-boolean
// expansion (only `true`/`false`/`null`/`~` are recognized) — that quirk is
// exactly what makes a bare `on:` trigger key read as the boolean `true` in
// a spec-following YAML 1.1 parser (PyYAML included), which every GitHub
// Actions workflow then has to work around. Skipping it here isn't a
// compatibility gap; a workflow's `on:` key means the literal word "on" to
// every tool that actually reads these files, GitHub's own parser included.

  // harmless (it's blank, so the structural view below already skips it),
